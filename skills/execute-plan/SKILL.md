# Execute Plan

**Announce:** "I'm using the execute-plan skill to implement the approved plan task by task."

## Overview

Read an approved implementation plan, create tasks from the task breakdown, execute each task sequentially with a quality gate after every task, and suggest ship when complete.

<HARD-GATE>
An approved plan MUST exist before this skill runs. If no plan exists (no plan mode file, no pasted plan, no plan-epic output), STOP immediately: "No approved plan found. Run plan-epic first, or paste your implementation plan."

NEVER search the codebase for context. The plan already has all file paths — read only what's listed.
NEVER run `yarn dev` or `yarn start` — only build checks.
</HARD-GATE>

## When to Use

- User approves a plan-epic plan and says "execute", "implement", "start implementing"
- User says "execute the plan", "run the plan", "execute tasks", "build from plan"
- User pastes a structured implementation plan and says "implement this"

### When NOT to Use

- No plan exists yet → use `plan-epic` to create one first
- Ready to commit and push → use `ship`
- Single task with no plan context → just implement it directly
- Need schema exploration → use `explore-schema`

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Ingest the Plan

**Find the plan:**
1. Check for plan mode file in `~/.claude/plans/` (most recent)
2. If user pasted plan text → use that directly
3. If neither found → STOP: "No plan found. Paste your plan or run plan-epic first."

**Parse the task breakdown.** For each task in `## Task Breakdown`, extract:

| Field | Source in plan | Required? |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| title | `### Task N: [Title]` | Yes |
| type | `Type:` line | No (infer from files) |
| service | `Service:` line | Yes |
| depends_on | `Depends on:` line | No (assume sequential) |
| effort | `Effort:` line | No (default M) |
| files_to_modify | `Files to modify:` list | Yes — STOP if missing |
| existing_code | `Existing code to reuse:` list | No |
| impl_notes | `Implementation notes:` list | No |

Also extract from the plan:
- `## Schema Changes` — for migration tasks
- `## API Changes` — for endpoint tasks
- `## Testing Strategy` — for test requirements per task
- `## Dependency Order` — for execution sequencing

**Create Claude Code tasks:**
Use TaskCreate for each parsed task. Set status to `pending`. This tracks progress across the session.

**Display the execution plan:**

```
EXECUTION PLAN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Source: [plan file path or "pasted plan"]
Tasks:  [N] total

  #  Status   Task                          Service           Effort
  1  PENDING  [title]                       [service]         S/M/L/XL
  2  PENDING  [title] (depends: Task 1)     [service]         S/M/L/XL
  3  PENDING  [title]                       [service]         S/M/L/XL

Estimated total: [sum of efforts]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Proceed? (yes / skip to task N / modify)
```

Wait for user confirmation before executing.

---

### Step 2: Execute Tasks (Sequential Loop)

For each task in dependency order:

#### 2a. Start Task

Mark task `in_progress` (TaskUpdate). Show header:

```
TASK [N]/[TOTAL]: [Title]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Type:    [type]
Service: [service path]
Effort:  [S/M/L/XL]
Files:   [count] to read, [count] to modify
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

#### 2b. Read Context

Read ONLY the files listed in the plan for this task. Use the Read tool directly — do NOT launch Explore subagents, do NOT Grep, do NOT Glob. The plan already did the exploration.

Read in this order:
1. `Existing code to reuse` files — understand patterns to follow
2. `Files to modify` files — understand what exists before changing it
3. If a file is listed but doesn't exist → it's a new file to create, note it

If a path from the plan doesn't exist and isn't a new file: flag it — "Plan references `{path}` but it doesn't exist. Skipping or ask user to clarify."

#### 2c. Implement

Follow CampX implementation order within each task:

**Backend task order:**
1. Entity changes (if any)
2. Migration file — write only, NEVER run. Always include `down()` method. File: `{TIMESTAMP}-{description}.ts`
3. DTOs — `class-validator` decorator on every field, never use `any`
4. Service methods — all business logic here, not in controller, `try/catch` on all async
5. Controller endpoints — `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)` on every controller class
6. Module registration — add to providers, controllers, imports as needed

**Frontend task order:**
1. Types/interfaces
2. API service functions
3. Components (prefer @campxdev/shared and @campxdev/react-blueprint)
4. Page components
5. Route registration

**CampX patterns to enforce:**
- No `any` types — explicit TypeScript
- No `console.log` — use NestJS `Logger`
- No `@ts-ignore`
- No `synchronize: true`
- `try/catch` on all async operations
- Parameterized queries (never string concatenation)
- `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)` on every controller
- File names: kebab-case | Classes: PascalCase | Functions: camelCase

#### 2d. Write Tests

For every new service method or controller endpoint, write tests alongside the implementation.

**Backend — test file location:**
```
{service}/src/{module}/__tests__/{file}.spec.ts
```

Minimum per new method/endpoint:
- Happy path test
- Error/edge case test
- Guard/auth test for controller endpoints

**Frontend — test file location:**
```
{app}/src/{feature}/__tests__/{Component}.test.tsx
```

Minimum:
- Render test
- User interaction test
- API error state test

Target: 80%+ coverage of new code.

#### 2e. Quality Gate

Run for the affected service/app:

```bash
cd /Users/ramchanderpeddada/Desktop/CampX/{service} && yarn test --passWithNoTests
cd /Users/ramchanderpeddada/Desktop/CampX/{service} && yarn tsc --noEmit
cd /Users/ramchanderpeddada/Desktop/CampX/{service} && yarn lint
```

Show results:

```
QUALITY GATE — Task [N]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Tests:      ✓ PASS  / ✗ FAIL ([X] tests, [Y] suites)
TypeScript: ✓ PASS  / ✗ FAIL ([X] errors)
Lint:       ✓ PASS  / ⚠ WARN ([X] warnings)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**On failure:**
- Tests FAIL → diagnose the failing test, fix the code or test, re-run
- TypeScript FAIL → read the error, fix type issues, re-run
- Lint WARN → note it, continue (non-blocking)
- Max 3 retry attempts per task. After 3 failures → STOP:

```
BLOCKED — Task [N]: [Title]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Quality gate failed after 3 attempts.

Errors:
  [list specific errors]

Action required:
  Please review manually. Fix the issue and say
  "retry task [N]" to continue.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

#### 2f. Complete Task

Mark task `completed` (TaskUpdate). Show:

```
TASK [N] COMPLETE ✓
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[title]
Files modified:  [list]
Files created:   [list]
Tests added:     [count]
Quality gate:    PASS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Progress: [N]/[TOTAL] tasks complete
```

Move to next task.

---

### Agent Teams Mode

**Only activate when user explicitly says "use agent teams" / "create a team" / "swarm this".**

If requested:
- Create an efficient agent team with worker teammates
- Assign each independent task (no `depends_on`) to a separate teammate
- Dependent tasks still run sequentially after their prerequisites
- Each teammate gets its own cold-start context brief: task title, files to read, implementation notes, CampX patterns
- All teammates use haiku model
- Quality gate runs per-task after each teammate completes

Do NOT proactively suggest agent teams — only use when explicitly requested.

---

### Step 3: Migration Safety Check

After all tasks complete, if ANY migration files were written:

```
MIGRATION FILES WRITTEN — Manual Run Required
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Files written (NOT run):
  1. {service}/src/migrations/{timestamp}-{name}.ts
  2. {service}/src/migrations/{timestamp}-{name}.ts

To run:
  cd {service} && yarn typeorm migration:run -d src/datasource.ts

⚠ NEVER auto-run migrations. Always confirm data + run manually.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

### Step 4: Final Summary & Handoff

Run quality gate one final time across ALL affected services:

```bash
cd /Users/ramchanderpeddada/Desktop/CampX/{service1} && yarn test --passWithNoTests && yarn tsc --noEmit
cd /Users/ramchanderpeddada/Desktop/CampX/{service2} && yarn test --passWithNoTests && yarn tsc --noEmit
```

Show the execution report:

```
EXECUTION COMPLETE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Plan:    [plan title]
Tasks:   [N]/[N] complete — ALL PASSED / [X] BLOCKED

  #  Status     Task                          Quality Gate
  1  COMPLETE   [title]                       PASS
  2  COMPLETE   [title]                       PASS
  3  BLOCKED    [title]                       FAIL (3 attempts)

Files modified:   [total count]
Files created:    [total count]
Tests added:      [total count]
Migrations:       [N] written (NOT run — manual execution required)

Final Quality Gate:
  Tests:      ✓ PASS
  TypeScript: ✓ PASS
  Lint:       ⚠ WARN ([N] warnings)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Ready to ship? Run: git diff  (review your changes first)
Then say "ship this" to invoke the ship skill.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Do NOT auto-invoke ship. The user decides when to ship.

---

## Red Flags - STOP

- "No plan, just start implementing" — STOP. Require a plan first. Run plan-epic or paste your plan.
- "Skip the quality gate" — NEVER. Quality gate runs after EVERY task, no exceptions.
- "Run the migration" — NEVER. Write the file only. Tell user to run manually.
- "Skip tests, add them later" — NEVER. Tests are written with each task.
- "Search the codebase for more context" — NEVER during execution. Trust the plan's file paths.
- "Run yarn dev to test it" — NEVER. Only build checks: `yarn test` and `yarn tsc --noEmit`.
- "3 quality gate failures — force through" — STOP. Ask user to review manually.

All of these mean: STOP and explain why the step cannot be skipped.

---

## Rules

1. NEVER execute without an approved plan — HARD-GATE enforced
2. NEVER search for files — read only what the plan lists
3. NEVER skip quality gate for any task — `yarn test` and `yarn tsc --noEmit` must pass per-task
4. NEVER run migrations — write the file only, user runs manually
5. NEVER run `yarn dev` or `yarn start` — only build checks
6. NEVER auto-invoke ship — user reviews and decides
7. Max 3 quality gate retry attempts per task — then STOP and ask

---

## Integration

- Called by: user after plan-epic approval ("execute the plan", "implement the plan", "start implementing")
- Calls: agent teams (haiku model workers) only if user explicitly requests
- Pairs with: `plan-epic` (produces the plan this skill consumes), `ship` (user invokes after execution)
